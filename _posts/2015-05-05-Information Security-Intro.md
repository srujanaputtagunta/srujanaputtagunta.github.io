Usually, most of us don't leave our cars and houses unlocked. We don't leave valuables unattended. But when it comes to information, we tend to be less careful. If we look at the recent hacking scandals, many of the victims left their password set to the factory default setting of password which made it easy for hackers. It shows that we need to be careful with information about ourselves and that which we handle for others.  Most of us whether at home or work have a lot of information on computers, smartphones, storage devices, tablets, paper etc. There is so much of it that we can become complacent. But the fact is we cannot afford to be complacent about security in today's world. What if these files got into the wrong hands? It could be a potential cause of embarrassment, inconvenience and public scandal!!<br/>

<br/>A lot of Information Security is about being more aware of the risks we are taking. Personal Information may be unimportant to us but to a criminal, it could be the key that opens doors! We need passwords for everything these days. The most common mistake that most people do is to have the same password for different websites. E.g. Social media, banking, online shopping etc. Criminals capture usernames, passwords and personal information from bogus sites. It is one of the most common ways that criminals can get our details. So using secure passwords is important but it is also very important to use different ones. And passwords are just the first line of defense. <br/>

<br/>For important information, Encryption is the most secure way to protect data making it almost impossible for criminals to use the data even if they do get through to it. That's why people encrypt data on laptops or USB memory sticks. Encryption is also used to make data transfer through the internet more secure. Websites that use encryption have an https address and a padlock symbol. Look for this if you are shopping online, using bank accounts or getting a quote for insurance.  Basically anytime when personal details and information are involved! <br/>

<br/>But what about written information on paper? We can be just as careless with written or printed documents. Have you ever left confidential information or documents left around lying on a desk, in a briefcase or on your computer monitor where someone could see it, copy it or print if off?  Ever hit reply to all on an email and not check who it was going to? It might be embarrassing, but it could be worse, a lot worse!!<br/> 

<br/>Sometimes, it is more about stopping others from gaining access. We wouldn't let a stranger follow in through the front door of our house, so why do we do this in secure areas of our workplace? This is called Tailgating. It might be embarrassing to say no or ask for an ID, but we never know what could happen! An imposter could go in posing as an IT person who came to repair a computer and instead install a small piece of software onto the system which allows hackers to see what was being typed on the computer and use this information to gather confidential information about the company. <br/>

<br/>Credit and debit cards are prime targets for criminals. Some clone them while others watch over your back while you type them in an ATM before stealing them. This is called Shoulder Surfing. Organized gangs and criminals are stealing personal information at such a rate that the cost of a credit card number or bank account details is about the same as a cup of coffee. Criminals are always looking for new ways to get our information and use it for profit.<br/>

<br/>There are three things that I as a Security enthusiast have been practicing over the last few months and recommend that everyone should do:<br/>

	1) Be aware of what information you have, how important it is and how secure it is
	2) Assess what could happen if it got lost or in the wrong hands
	3) Make sure you have adequate protections in place to protect it

<br/>Although it may be difficult for us to see the value of information that we handle everyday, we need to get into the habit of protecting our own and others' information in the same way as we protect our valuables and the things we care about.
