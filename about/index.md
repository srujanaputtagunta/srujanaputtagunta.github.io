<p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi! I'm Srujana and I am an aspiring Information Security Professional. I am also an avid reader, adventurer and a travel enthusiast. I am really passionate about Security and by writing this blog, I intend to share my knowledge with you as I progress towards my goal.</p>

I believe there are three basic factors that make people successful:
<br>

>>Persistence. Nothing in this world can takes the place of persistence. Talent will not. A little more persistence and a little more effort. That is all that matters.

>>Listening to those who matter, and tuning out those who don’t. You can safely ignore the friend/family member who tells you that you won’t ever make it. It's important to listen to those who truly believe in you and your abilities.

>>Creating on a consistent basis. Actually creating something, every single day, is how you build stepping stones to success.
